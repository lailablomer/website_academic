In my PhD, I am studying the behavior of voltage-gated ion channels during action potential back-propagation layer-5 pyramidal cells. Under the supervision of [Dr. Marco Canepari](https://marco-canepari.wixsite.com/neuron-imaging-team/about_us), the goal of my project is to extract the diverse sodium, calcium and potassium currents underlying the action potential back-propagation.

To experimentally investigate the activity of individual ion channels, I am combining optical recordings with pharmacological tools to selectively target individual types of ion channels, in particular with the use of photo-activable toxins developed by our collaborators. The purpose of these experiments is to produce a set of data and then to reproduce the experimental scenario with [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) models in order to extract the native behavior of each channel, as well as their functional interactions.

Initially, the goal is to extract the patterns of ion channel behavior under physiological conditions and afterwards I aim to study ion channel behaviors in various channelopathies.
