In the mammalian brain the shape of neuronal potentials is the result of the sequential activation, inactivation and de-activation of several voltage gated (VG) ion channels, belonging to different families. Indeed, ion channel expression and distribution make up an essential part of a cells machinery, and mutations in these channels can lead to severe diseases and disorders. Therefore, the biophysical properties of ion channels are an important field of research, and the subject of this thesis. Specifically, I investigated the contribution of VG Ca2+ channels (VGCC), VG Na+ channels (VGNC), VG K+ channels (VGKC) and Ca2+ activated K+ channels (CAKC) to action potential (AP) initiation at the axon initial segment (AIS) and AP back propagation (bAP) into the apical dendrite of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PN). The methodology, described in the second chapter, consists of electrophysiological recordings of L5PNs in acute mouse brain slices, combined with ultrafast imaging to record the membrane potential (Vm), Ca2+ and Na+ transients and pharmacological analyses using selective channel blockers. To confirm our experimental results we develop computational models using the NEURON software. We show that analysing VG channels in synergy is essential to understand their interactions and their individual contributions to the AP. The results of my work are reported in two chapters. Chapter 3 reports on a study on AP generation in the AIS, driven by VGNCs. Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 are the two expressed isoforms of VGNCs, and their role is crucial to the AP shape. Studying these VGNCs has been limited by a lack of pharmacological tools to distinguish between the two. Here, we used the novel peptide G1G4 -huwentoxin-IV and show its partial selectivity for Nav1.2 over Nav1.6. Exploiting this inhibitor to partially block Nav1.2, we recorded the effect on Na+ currents, Vm waveforms and Ca2+ currents associated with the AP. We demonstrate that the exclusive permeability of Nav1.2 to Ca2+ allows activation of large conductance (BK) CAKCs in the AIS. The interplay between Nav1.2, mediating the AP rise, and BK CAKCs, regulating the peak and the early phase of the AP repolarisation, shapes the AP waveform. To confirm our findings, we created a NEURON model of the AIS. This allowed simulating the interaction between Nav1.2 and BK channels and mimic the experimental results obtained by blocking Nav1.2 with G1G4 -huwentoxin-IV. Chapter 4 reports on the AP that back propagates into the dendrite after its generation at the AIS. This bAP is associated with a large Ca2+ influx, which we recorded ∼100 µm from the soma. We show that all neuronal VGCCs contribute to the Ca2+ current. We show that a VGCC subtype, N-type VGCCs, mediate activation of BK CAKCs through close functional coupling. Using Vm imaging we show the effect of their interplay occurs in the 500 µs after the bAP peak but before the expected Ca2+ current peak. This result suggests a physical interaction between BK and N-type channels. We confirm these results with a preliminary NEURON model, connecting the AIS and apical dendrite. Taken together, we propose a dual, spatially restricted role of BK CAKCs. Firstly by shaping the generating AP in the AIS through its interaction with Nav1.2. Secondly by driving fast repolarisation through functional coupling with N-type VGCCs during a bAP in the apical dendrite, in this way controlling the activation of the other VGCCs. The synergistic approach of analysing the contributions of the various VG ion channels to the AP generation and back propagation allowed for the discovery of the close functional coupling between BK CAKCs and Nav1.2 and N-type VGCCs in the AIS and apical dendrite, respectively. Together with our modelling efforts, these experiments provide a basis to study the dysfunction of VG ion channels in neuropathologies, such as autism and epilepsy.
