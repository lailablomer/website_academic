In the intricate world of neuronal activity, Nav1.2 voltage-gated Na+ channels play a crucial role at the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons for the generation of action potentials (APs). But what occurs on the physiological level when these gates malfunction? To understand the changes associated with these Nav1.2 channelopathies we turned to a heterozygous Scn2a+/- KO mouse model revealing an autistic-like phenotype, memory impairment, and reduced stress reactivity during the third and fourth postnatal weeks. Using ultrafast Na+, Ca2+, and membrane potential (Vm) imaging, we show a slight reduction in Na+ influx at the proximal AIS in Scn2a+/- mice compared to their wild-type (Scn2a+/+) counterparts. Our findings also highlight an alteration in the Ca2+ influx raising the intriguing question of how Nav1.2 loss-of-function affects the AP waveform, particularly within the distal AIS, where Nav1.2 mediates the calcium influx regulating the shape of generating AP.
