[Feed Your Brain](http://feedyourbrain.eu/) is a startup to optimise brain and mind health by PhD student Emilie Steinbach. As an independent consultant, I have consulted several startups. Specifically, I have consulted [Survivor](https://survivorlife.com/) on the scientific basis of their products. Survivor is "a revolutionary food supplement designed to reduce alcoholâ€™s negative impact on health and productivity". 

Founder of FYB Emilie is a neuroscientist, and her previous research focused on sleep physiology and mitochondrial Biology. She is now working in academic research on Nutrition and Microbiology. Through FYB, Emilie gives conferences and consults in several startups in the health sector.
