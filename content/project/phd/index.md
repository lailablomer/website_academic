In pyramidal neurons, action potentials originating in the axon initial segment not only propagate along the axon to reach synaptic terminals, but they also back-propagate in dendrites signalling to the compartments where the cell receives synaptic inputs. Action potential back-propagation has been widely studied, but the exact synergistic behaviours of the multiple ion channels underlying this phenomenon remain elusive, in particular with respect to channelopathies that can compromise this important cellular mechanism.

In my research, I am studying the behaviour of voltage-gated ion channels during action potential back-propagation layer-5 pyramidal cells. The goal of my PhD is to extract the diverse sodium, calcium and potassium currents underlying the action potential back-propagation.

To experimentally investigate the activity of individual ion channels, I am combining cutting-edge optical recordings with advanced pharmacological tools to selectively target individual types of ion channels, in particular with the use of photo-activable toxins developed by our collaborators. Optical measurements of calcium and voltage are performed in the dendrites of 5th layer pyramidal cells at 10-20 kHz, an acquisition rate that allows tracking the fast kinetics of voltage gated ion channels. The effect of blocking individual channels is measured at multiple locations along the dendrites. The purpose of these experiments is to produce a set of data and then to reproduce the experimental scenario with NEURON models where the parameters of ion channels are adjusted in order to extract the native behaviour of each channel, as well as their functional interactions. Notably, while an ion indicator provides direct information on the related ion channels, this approach also allows exploring the ion channels where an ion measurement is unavailable, in particular potassium channels. 

Initially, I want to extract the patterns of ion channel behaviour under physiological conditions and later I want to study ion channel behaviours in various diseases.
