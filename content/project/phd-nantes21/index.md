The Laboratory of Excellence in Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics (LabEx ICST) comprises 16 teams from 5 research units: Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IPMC, Sophia Antipolis), Laboratoire de Physio-Médecine Moléculaire (LP2M, Nice), Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle (IGF, Montpellier), Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences (GIN), Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS, Grenoble) and Laboratoire de Physiologie Cellulaire (PhyCell, Villeneuve d'Asq).

The overall ambition of ICST is to become a world-wide recognized clusters in ion channel studies carrying research and innovation at the interface of biology and medecine.

Due to the COVID crisis the meeting had been postponed for two years in a row, but November 2021 we came together at last. It was my first meeting, and I presented the results from the first two years of my thesis, entitled *L-type and N-type calcium channels activation of K+ channels regulates dendritic action potential back-propagation in layer-5 neocortical pyramidal neurons*. Find the figures from my poster at the top of the page in Slides.
