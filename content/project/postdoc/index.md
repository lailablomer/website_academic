Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by neuropsychiatric illnesses, including autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), in which epilepsy is often a co-morbidity. Voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) are essential for generation and propagation of action potentials (APs), and mutations of major central nervous system alpha-subunit NaV isoforms (NaV1.1, SCN1A gene, NaV1.2/SCN2A and NaV1.6/SCN8A) are implicated in different types of epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Notably, heterozygous mutations of NaV1.2 cause a remarkably large clinical spectrum, and Partner 1 has contributed to disclose NaV1.2 (dys-)functions. In particular, numerous NaV1.2 mutations cause severe late infantile-childhood neurodevelopmental disorders (LICND) with onset between /3 months and few years of age, but with different features: a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) with various degrees of ASD and intellectual disability (ID) b) severe ASD without epilepsy, c) severe ID without epilepsy & d) schizophrenia without epilepsy. Notably, recent large-scale human genetic studies have indicated that NaV1.2 mutations are among those that show the strongest association with severe ASD.

Performing functional studies of human mutations in transfected cells, it has been proposed that LICND mutations induce reduction of NaV1.2 function. The lab of Dr Massimo Mantegazza has discovered a novel pathological mechanism for mutations causing LICND with severe ASD: they do not induce just pure loss of function, but cause negative dominance (NegD) on wild-type channels, leading to >50% total reduction of NaV1.2 function in heterozygosis. Importantly, there are no effective treatments for LICND, which are caused by loss of function or NegD of NaV1.2. Na+ channel blockers, which are not isoform specific, have been used for decades to treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases, but they worsen the phenotype of LICND patients, and no NaV1.2 enhancers are available for increasing its function. Moreover, mechanisms linking reduced NaV1.2 function and clinical phenotypes are not completely understood yet. This contrasts with NaV1.2 mutations that cause gain of function, identified in epileptic patients showing neonatal-infantile onset that often can be treated with classical Na+ channel blocker antiepileptic drugs.

The objectives of NaV1.2RESCUE are to:
- develop drugs and strategies for counteracting reduced NaV1.2 function and NegD (novel therapeutic target completely unexplored thus far), which are unavailable and could be used to treat severe LICND;
- exploit established and develop new gene targeted animal models of NaV1.2 loss of function and NegD, studying effects of treatments and pathological mechanisms;
- use novel cutting-edge imaging techniques for studying detailed mechanisms and evaluate effects of treatments, optically measuring Na+ currents in neuronal sub-compartments.
