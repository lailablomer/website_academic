**L-type and N-type calcium channels activation of K+ channels regulates dendritic action potential back-propagation in layer-5 neocortical pyramidal neurons** 

*Laila BLÖMER, Luiza FILIPIS & Marco CANEPARI*

## Introduction
- In pyramidal neurons, action potentials (AP) originating in the axon initial segment not only propagate along the axon, but they also back-propagate into dendrites. 
- Back-propagating APs (bAP) have been widely studied, but the exact synergistic behaviours of the multiple ion channels underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. 

--- 

- Neocortical layer-5 (L5) pyramidal neurons express a diverse voltage gated ion channels, including high and low voltage activated Ca²⁺ channels (VGCCs) , a Na+ channel (Nav1.2), Ca²⁺-activated K+ channels (CaKCs: SK and BK), and voltage activated K+ channels. 
- Here we present data on how N- and L-type calcium channels can regulate bAPs through an interplay with Ca²⁺-activated potassium channels.

## Conclusions
- Blocking N-type channels results in an increase in the calcium signal and current. This can be explained by a functional coupling between N channels and CaKCs.
- Blocking N-type channels causes an increase in the bAP peak, as does blocking BK channels. 
- Blocking BK channels, SK channels or L-type channels results in an increase in the integral of the membrane potential transient.

## Perspectives #1
The present results suggest that N-type channels open fast compared to other VGCCs, as we observed that the total calcium current peaks 0.7 ms after the bAP peak and contributes little to the AP peak. They also point to a possible coupling with BK and SK channels where calcium directly activates CaKCs. 

---
## Perspectives #2
Further investigations including the other VGCCs will shed light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the back-propagating potential. In addition, computational modelling in NEURON will help us better understand the role of N-type channels during AP backpropagation.
