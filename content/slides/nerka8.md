# NERKA8 Poster
**SK and BK Ca2+-activated K+ channels are triggered by different Ca2+ sources in the axon initial segment of neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons**

## Abstract
- Voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGNCs) expressed in the axon initial segment (AIS) of neuronal cells mediate the Na+ current underlying the membrane potential (Vm) rise of the generating action potential (AP). 
- It has been recently shown that in neocortical  layer-5 (L5) pyramidal neurons VGNCs also mediate Ca2+ influx, thus potentially regulating the AP fall by activating Ca2+-activated K+ channels (CAKCs). 

--- 

- Here, using Vm imaging of the AP in the AIS, we analysed the effect of locally inhibiting SK and BK CAKCs demonstrating that SK channels are exclusively activated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels whereas BK channels are activated by another Ca2+ source.       

---

## Materials & Methods

- Experiments were performed on brain slices (300  µm thick)from 21-35 day old mice. L5 pyramidal neurons were filled with voltage sensitive dye via a whole-cell patch clamp recording also used to inject current pulses and to monitor somatic Vm.
- Vm fluorescence was excited with a laser at 530 nm and recorded at >610 nm with a camera (either CCD or CMOS).

---

- Images of ~64X15 µm2 comprising the AIS were acquired at 10-20 kHz.  
- To distinguish signals from proximal and distal areas of the AIS, with respect to the soma, we  analysed every signal in a region of 5 µm at a position “1”, within 5 and 15 µm from the soma and in a region of 5 µm at a position “2”, within 30 and 40 µm from the soma.

## Results #1

- a, Left, fluorescence image (voltage sensitive dye JPW1114) of the AIS and its reconstruction with a proximal region (1) and a distal (2) region indicated; a somatic AP before and after locally delivering 1 µM of the SK CAKC inhibitor apamin (apam) is reported below.  Right, Somatic AP in control solution and after apamin delivery and associated Vm transients in 1 and 2. 
- b, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by locally delivering 1 µM of the BK CAKC inhibitor iberiotoxin (ibtx).

## Results #2

- c, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by sequentially blocking first VGCCs only and then VGCCs and SK CAKCs with additional apamin. 
- d, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by sequentially blocking first VGCCs only and then VGCCs and BK CAKCs with additional iberiotoxin.

## Results #4


- f, Top, single values and percentage change of the proximal ∫Vm signal maximum after delivering apamin, iberiotoxin or the cocktail of VGCCs blockers. Bottom, in the same cells, single values and percentage change of the distal ∫Vm signal maximum after delivering drugs. 
- g, Top, with respect to the block of VGCCs, single values and percentage change of the proximal  ∫Vm signal maximum after delivering apamin or iberiotoxin. Bottom, in the same cells, single values and percentage change of the distal ∫Vm signal maximum after delivering apamin or iberiotoxin. "*" significant change (p<0.01, paired t-test).

---

## Conclusions
- The widening effects produced by apamin were similar to those produced by blocking VGCCs. 
- When VGCCs were previously blocked, however, further addition of apamin did not change the ∫Vm signal. 
- In contrast, further addition of iberiotoxin increased the ∫Vm signal by ~12% at the proximal AIS sites and by ~21% at the distal AIS sites. 
- We conclude that SK CAKCs are activated exclusively by VGCCs, whereas BK CAKCs are also activated by the other Ca2+ source, i.e. by VGNCs.
