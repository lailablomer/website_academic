Title: SK and BK Ca2+-activated K+ channels are triggered by different Ca2+ sources in the axon initial segment of neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons

Authors: Laila BLÖMER, Luiza FILIPIS & Marco CANEPARI

## Abstract
- Voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGNCs) expressed in the axon initial segment (AIS) of neuronal cells mediate the Na+ current underlying the membrane potential (Vm) rise of the generating action potential (AP). 
- It has been recently shown that in neocortical  layer-5 (L5) pyramidal neurons VGNCs also mediate Ca2+ influx, thus potentially regulating the AP fall by activating Ca2+-activated K+ channels (CAKCs). 

--- 

- Here, using Vm imaging of the AP in the AIS, we analysed the effect of locally inhibiting SK and BK CAKCs demonstrating that SK channels are exclusively activated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels whereas BK channels are activated by another Ca2+ source.

## Results #2
a, Left, fluorescence image (voltage sensitive dye JPW1114) of the AIS and its reconstruction with a proximal region (1) and a distal (2) region indicated; a somatic AP before and after locally delivering 1 µM of the SK CAKC inhibitor apamin (apam) is reported below.  Right, Somatic AP in control solution and after apamin delivery and associated Vm transients in 1 and 2. b, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by locally delivering 1 µM of the BK CAKC inhibitor iberiotoxin (ibtx). c, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by sequentially blocking first VGCCs only and then VGCCs and SK CAKCs with additional apamin. d, In another cell, same experimental protocol of panel a but by sequentially blocking first VGCCs only and then VGCCs and BK CAKCs with additional iberiotoxin.
