abstract: The action potential (AP) generated in the axon actively back-propagates into the dendrites through the sequential activation and deactivation of diverse ion channels, but the full understanding of the role of each conductance remains elusive. Here, using ultrafast membrane potential (Vm) and Ca2+ imaging, we show that N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), activated by the back-propagating AP in the apical dendrite of layer-5 neocortical pyramidal neurons, selectively target large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK CAKCs). We show that this BK CAKC activation occurs within 500 µs following the AP peak, i.e. before the peak of the Ca2+ current elicited by the AP. This way, when N-type VGCCs are inhibited, the early widening of the AP shape boosts the other activated VGCCs increasing the total Ca2+ influx. We built a realistic NEURON model showing that a strong coupling between N-type and BK channels is necessary to reproduce the experimental results. Thus, this study demonstrates the N-type VGCC, which is conventionally considered a presynaptic mediator of neurotransmitter release, has an exclusive specific role in neuronal dendrites as activator of BK CAKCs. In addition, the present results represent an original functional validation of a physical interaction between a Ca2+ and K+ channels obtained by ultrafast reconstruction of their kinetics.
